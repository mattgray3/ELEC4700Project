%-Chose to go about plotting the State Space representation

%Tests
%- Run as created in Milestone 8
%- Adjust the betas AKA Detuning
%- Adjust the grating
%- Change the Length of the laser

%What I Have Done So Far
%- Tried breaking it with detuning
%- System is stable, plot makes a loop

%- Tried breaking with changing the length
%- System is Staable with the plot comong back to the start

%- Broke the System with grating
%- Different Grating Setups provide different state space patterns

%Next Steps
%- Grating
%- Change len
%- Try breaking it
